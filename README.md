# Does-Hosting-the-Olympics-Provide-a-Performance-Boost-The-Athens-2004-Case-Study
This project explores whether hosting the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics significantly influenced Greece’s Olympic performance. Using Python for data analysis and visualization, we examine trends in Greece’s medal counts, efficiency (medals per athlete), and how its results compare with other host nations from 2000 to 2020.
